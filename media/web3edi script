Welcome to Web 3 Edi the easy way to learn about Web 3 in Web 3. Web 3 Edi is designed to use IPFS/Filecoin, hosted through Fleek, and NFTs as the medium of recognition of student learning. The platform enables students to join schools for a monthly fee entitling them to exclusive course discounts and access. Each student gets a dashboard and a choice of recorded learning where they complete in situ quizes and Live learning where they can interact with their course instructors over the Livepeer network. Instructors have an IPFS powered dashboard that enables them to upload course and manage course data as well as the ability to host live interactive classes with data storage supported by IPFS. 

Our goal is to build out the platform to support a market place for our minted course offering enabling students to easily exchange their old courses whilst finding new ones.
